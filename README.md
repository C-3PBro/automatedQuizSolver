# Automated quiz solver (maze of oedipus)

Little python project to automatically solve the maze of oedipus as described on http://holdirdeinenvertrag.de using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

### Prerequisites

* Selenium 
* BeautifulSoup

In the code I use the chromdriver.exe (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads/) as a webdriver for Selenium. For the code to run properly, specify the file location of the chromedriver.exe (line 25 in the code). Other packages used in the code are 're' and 'time'.
